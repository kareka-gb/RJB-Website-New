Some run towards the lappies and some go out on a voyage with a Pendrive to collect the new movies and the games for the sake of increasing their collection. There is also a bunch who utilize their time by taking short naps in installment. For the rest, the only place they can love is RJB TV Room. With the ultimate HDTV and Tata sky DTH connectivity its the noisiest place on matchdays. The symbolic howling of the students easily convey the fours and sixes to whole Bhawan.
